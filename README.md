## Introduction
This project proposal outlines our plan to create an AI-powered education hub that addresses the need for accessible teaching materials on business and climate change. The hub will serve as a central platform for faculty members at business schools across the United States, reducing barriers to sharing open-access syllabi, course materials, and cases.

## Project Overview
- **Project Title:** AI-Powered Education Hub for Business and Climate Change
- **Duration:** Two days

## Team
Our team consists of five members with various expertise:
- 2 front-end developers
- 3 back-end developers
- 1 UI designer

## Problem Statement
Business schools are increasingly recognizing the importance of integrating climate change topics into their curricula. However, the lack of readily available open-access teaching resources makes it challenging for faculty to develop or update their courses. Our project aims to solve this problem.

## Project Goals
1. Develop a user-friendly web application that serves as a central hub for business and climate change education resources.
2. Implement AI-driven features to curate and recommend relevant teaching materials.
3. Create a platform for faculty to easily upload and share open-access syllabi, course materials, and cases.
4. Enable collaborative content creation and customization for educators.
5. Enhance the user experience with an intuitive and visually appealing UI.

## Proposed Solution
### Front-End Development
Front-end developers will focus on creating an engaging and responsive user interface for the education hub. Key tasks include:
- Designing the user interface.
- Developing interactive search and filtering options.
- Implementing user authentication and access control.
- Integrating real-time notifications.
- Ensuring mobile responsiveness.

### Back-End Development
Back-end developers will build the core functionality of the platform. Key tasks include:
- Developing the back-end server and database architecture.
- Creating AI algorithms for content recommendation.
- Implementing user authentication and role-based access control.
- Designing and implementing an API for data retrieval and content management.
- Ensuring data security and privacy compliance.

### UI Designer
The UI designer will collaborate with front-end developers to create a visually appealing and intuitive user interface. Key tasks include:
- Designing wireframes and mockups.
- Creating a cohesive design system.
- Providing design assets and style guides.
- Conducting user testing and gathering feedback.

## Expected Outcomes
At the end of the two-day hackathon, we aim to deliver a functional prototype of the education hub with features such as:
- User-friendly web application.
- Search and filtering capabilities.
- User authentication and access control.
- AI-driven content recommendations.
- Basic functionality for faculty to upload and share teaching materials.

## Future Development
Future development can focus on expanding the platform's capabilities, including:
- Advanced AI algorithms for content recommendation.
- Enhanced content creation and collaboration features.
- Integration with external APIs for additional resources.
- Mobile applications for on-the-go access.
- Analytics and reporting features for educators.

## Conclusion
Syllabot aims to leverage AI to facilitate the teaching of business and climate change at peer business schools across the United States. By creating an AI-powered education hub, we reduce barriers for faculty to share their open-access syllabi, course materials, and cases and enhance the educational experience. This project aligns with the growing demand for sustainability-focused education and promotes collaboration among educators in addressing climate change challenges.
